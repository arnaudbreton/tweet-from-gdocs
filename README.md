Google Drive Word Processor unlike Spreadsheet doesn't offer a full integration of Google App Script (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/?hl=fr).

An issue is open at Google about this feature : http://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=721&sort=-stars&colspec=Stars%20Opened%20ID%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Component%20Owner

It would be interesting to add some features by this way.

This project will try to add some Twitter's related features to Google Drive Word Processor, to enhance note-taking and make it more social.

Feel free to help and support us,
Thanks by advance!
